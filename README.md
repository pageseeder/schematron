# Schematron Validator

## About this library

This library provides a simple Schematron validator in Java.

This project was initially forked from Google Code <https://code.google.com/p/schematron/> and 
retains large portions of the code licenced under MIT and developed by Rick Jelliffe and others.

We simply wanted a different and simpler Java API.

## Dependencies

This library requires an XSLT processor at runtime.

## Testing

If you want to test the code, ensure that you add the following to the ANT classpath:
- Saxon (available in text/lib)
- Either a version of the jar or both the /src and /classes folders
